# 🧱 Basic – A2Z DSA Sheet

This folder contains beginner-level Python programs that cover the foundational concepts needed before diving into data structures and algorithms. These problems focus on basic syntax, control flow, user input, and fundamental operations.

## 📄 Files & Descriptions

### 1. `For_loop.py`
**🔹 Task:** Print squares of numbers from 1 to `n`.

**🧠 Logic:**
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n`.
- In each iteration, computes `i*i` and prints it.

---

### 2. `If_else.py`
**🔹 Task:** Print grade based on the score input.

**🧠 Logic:**
- Uses `if-elif-else` statements to compare the score.
- Depending on the score range, it prints grades from A to F.

📝 Note: One of the outputs uses `'c'` instead of `'C'` — you may want to fix the capitalization for consistency.

### 3. `Swicth_case.py`
**🔹 Task:** Perform a math operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`) on two numbers using `match-case` (Python 3.10+).

**🧠 Logic:**
- Takes an operator and two numbers as input.
- Uses `match-case` to select and apply the corresponding arithmetic operation.

---

### 4. `User_defined.py`
**🔹 Task:** Print a number using a user-defined function.

**🧠 Logic:**
- Simple custom function that takes a number and prints it.
- Demonstrates the basics of function definition and calling.

---

### 5. `While_loop.py`
**🔹 Task:** Reverse the digits of a number (additional logic for digit count and sum included as comments).

**🧠 Logic:**
- Uses a `while` loop to extract digits using `% 10`.
- Prints each digit in reverse order (last to first).
- Also includes commented-out versions for counting digits and summing digits.

## 🚀 Notes

- All programs use `input()` to take user input.
- Good for learning how to structure basic logic and control flow.
- Useful as a warm-up before diving into array or string problems.
